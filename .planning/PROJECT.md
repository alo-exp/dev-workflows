# Silver Bullet

## What This Is

Agentic Process Orchestrator for AI-native Software Engineering & DevOps. Silver Bullet combines GSD, Superpowers, Engineering, and Design plugins into enforced workflows with 7 layers of compliance — guiding users from idea to deployed software without requiring any prior knowledge of the underlying tools.

## Core Value

Single enforced workflow that eliminates the gap between "what AI should do" and "what AI actually does" — 7 compliance layers, zero single-point-of-bypass, complete user hand-holding from start to finish.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ 7-layer enforcement (hooks fire automatically) — v0.7.0
- ✓ 8 quality dimension gates (modularity through extensibility) — v0.7.0
- ✓ full-dev-cycle workflow (20 steps, app dev) — v0.7.0
- ✓ devops-cycle workflow (24 steps, infrastructure) — v0.7.0
- ✓ Blast radius assessment for DevOps changes — v0.7.0
- ✓ IaC-adapted quality gates (7 dimensions) — v0.7.0
- ✓ DevOps skill router for vendor plugin selection — v0.7.0
- ✓ Pre-release quality gate (§9 four-stage) — v0.7.4
- ✓ 4 gap-filling skills promoted to enforced gates — v0.8.0
- ✓ SENTINEL security hardening (P-1 through P-7) — v0.8.0
- ✓ GSD-mainstay orchestration: workflow files guide 100% of GSD process — v0.13.0
- ✓ silver-bullet.md overhaul: GSD process knowledge, hand-holding instructions — v0.13.0
- ✓ /silver smart router: routes freeform input to best SB or GSD skill — v0.13.0
- ✓ SB orchestration skill files (silver-feature/bugfix/ui/devops/research/release/fast) — v0.13.0
- ✓ Website content refresh — v0.13.0

### Active

- [ ] AI-driven spec creation: SB guides PM/BA through requirements elicitation, UX flows, design
- [ ] JIRA ingestion: pull ticket + linked artifacts (Google Docs, PPT, Figma) via MCP connectors
- [ ] External artifact ingestion: incorporate Google Docs, PPTs, Figma at any point during spec process
- [ ] Standardized spec output: produce industry-standard .md specs (requirements, design, final spec) in repo
- [ ] Multi-repo spec referencing: main repo specs as source of truth, mobile repos reference them
- [ ] Pre-build spec validation: gap analysis, conflict detection, assumption surfacing before implementation
- [ ] PR → spec traceability: auto-link PRs to spec artefacts that drove implementation
- [ ] GSD minimum spec floor: enforce minimum viable spec even in fast-path
- [ ] UAT as formal pipeline gate: verify implementation against original spec

### Out of Scope

- Replacing GSD's execution engine — GSD owns execution, SB orchestrates
- Admin/utility GSD commands (gsd-manager, gsd-settings, gsd-stats, gsd-note, etc.) — accessible but not guided
- Modifying third-party plugin files — §8 boundary enforced
- Building custom integrations for external tools — use Claude Desktop MCP connectors / CLIs
- Nomadic Care-specific naming conventions or file structures — SB provides generic patterns

## Current Milestone: v0.14.0 AI-Driven Spec & Multi-Repo Orchestration

**Goal:** Transform SB from "plan and execute code" into "drive the entire SDLC from requirements elicitation through implementation" — SB leads spec creation, ingests external artifacts as inputs, and coordinates across repos.

**Target features:**
- A: JIRA → SB ingestion (ticket + linked artifacts via MCP connectors)
- B: AI-driven spec creation (SB guides PM/BA step-by-step through requirements, UX, design)
- C: External artifact ingestion (Google Docs, PPT, Figma incorporated at any point)
- D: Standardized spec output (industry-standard .md in repo, no human-authored .md required)
- E: Multi-repo spec referencing (main repo specs → mobile repo implementation sessions)
- F: Pre-build validation (gap analysis, conflict detection, assumption surfacing)
- G: PR → spec traceability (auto-link PRs to spec artefacts)
- H: GSD minimum spec floor (fast-path requires minimum spec)
- I: UAT as formal pipeline gate (verify implementation against spec)

**Architecture principle:** Reuse existing plugin skills via orchestration; create new skills only when no dependency covers the capability.

## Context

- Stack: Node.js (shell hooks, markdown skills, HTML site)
- Repository: https://github.com/alo-exp/silver-bullet.git
- GSD version: 1.32.0 (~60 commands, wave-based parallel execution)
- Superpowers version: 5.0.5 (14 skills — code review, TDD, debugging, branch mgmt)
- Engineering/Design: Anthropic knowledge-work-plugins (6+6 skills)
- Current version: v0.13.2 (Hook hardening + init hook registration)

## Constraints

- **Plugin boundary**: Must not modify GSD/Superpowers/Engineering/Design plugin files (§8)
- **Enforcement integrity**: All 7 enforcement layers must remain functional during and after restructuring
- **Template parity**: docs/workflows/ must always match templates/workflows/
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing .silver-bullet.json configs must continue to work

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| silver-bullet.md.base is single source for enforcement §0-9 | One template, no drift | ✓ Good |
| CLAUDE.md.base reduced to minimal scaffold | User owns CLAUDE.md, SB owns silver-bullet.md | ✓ Good |
| Update mode overwrites silver-bullet.md without confirmation | SB-owned file | ✓ Good |
| GSD owns execution, SB owns orchestration + enforcement | Clean separation of concerns | ✓ Good |
| Forensics: evolve (GSD-aware routing), don't remove | SB forensics handles session-level issues GSD doesn't | — Pending |
| 20 GSD commands guided, ~40 unguided | Core SDLC + select utilities only | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
